# unscrambles

# Write a program which picks a random word from a list of words,
# then scrambles the letters
# and repeatedly asks the user to guess the word and
# checks to see if they got the right word.  There may be multiple ways
# to unscramble a sequence of letters to form a word in the list, but
# the user has to find the one the computer generates, e.g.
# 'aet'  could be 'eat' or 'tea' or 'eta'
# The user can first specify how many letters the words should have
# The user can also give up if they want

# The program should let the user continue until they want to quit and then tell them
# how many words they unscrambled of each length and how many they gave up on.

a = 7
def setA(value):
    global a   # declare a to be a global
    a = value  # this sets the global value of a
    print('From Function',a)
print('Global',a)
setA(100)
print('After function',a)
