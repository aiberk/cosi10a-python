# You are to write a program that quizzes students on a kind of algebra problem:
#     multiplication of binomials  (ax+b)*(cx+d)
# It should continue to do so until they want to stop and it should keep track of how many they ask and how many they get right.
# Also, the problems should be randomly generated with a,b,c,d in the range [-10,10] and you can construct the answer
#   u*x^2 + v*x +w
# where u = ac  v=ad+bc and w = bd
