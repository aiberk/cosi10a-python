# Modify the code below so that it creates two lists. one of the even numbers and another of the odd numbers
# and prints them both out. You can test if a number n is even using  n%2==0

# vals = []  # accumulator variable
# val = int(input("enter an integer: "))
# while val>0:
#     vals.append(val)
#     val = int(input("enter another integer, 0 to stop: "))
# vals.reverse()
# print(vals)

# Hint: have two accumulator variables
# even_vals=[]
# odd_vals=[]
# and append val to the appropriate one in the loop
