# Write a function years2billionseconds which converts years into billions of seconds.
# It should call years2minutes to do the calculation..

# Expand on this code:
# def years2days(years):
#     "convert years to days"
#     days = years*365.25
#     return days

# def years2minutes(years):
#     "convert years to minutes"
#     days = years2days(years)
#     minutes = days*24*60
#     return minutes
