# Write the Python code to find out the monthly payment of a $40000 loan
#  at 6% interest for 60 months...


# A salaried person took home loan from a bank of $100,000 at the rate of interest of 10% for a period of 20 years. Now, we have to calculate the EMI amount and interest component paid to the bank.

# P = $100,000
# r= 10% i.e 0.1
# t = 20
# n = 12
# Amortization is Calculated Using Below formula:

# ƥ = rP / n * [1-(1+r/n)-nt]
# ƥ = 0.1 * 100,000 / 12 * [1-(1+0.1/12)-12*20]
# ƥ = 965.0216
# And now, to calculate interest paid we will put value in interest formula.

# I = nƥt – P
# I = 12*965.0216*20 – 100,000
# I = $131,605.2
# So, interest paid on loan is $131,605.2.
