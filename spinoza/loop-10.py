# DNA has very specific base pairing rules. A with T, C with G. Take our DNA strand and write a function, translate, 
# that returns a new string with the translation.

# For example, translate("ATTGC") would return "TAACG", where the A's get translated to T's
#  (and vice versa), and the G's get translated to C's (and vice versa)
