# Slide rule multiplication.
# Write a Python script which asks the user for two positive numbers x and y
# and shows that 
# x*y = exp(log(x)+log(y))
# by printing out log(x), log(y), log(x)+log(y), and exp(log(x)+log(y))
# and showing that this is equal to x*y.

# Your output should look like the following:
# x> 3
# y> 9
# --------------------
# x= 3.0
# y= 9.0
# log( 3.0 )= 1.0986122886681098
# log( 9.0 )= 2.1972245773362196
# log( 3.0 )+log( 9.0 )= 3.295836866004329
# exp( 3.295836866004329 )= 27.0
# 3.0 * 9.0 = 27.0
