# Write a python script which asks the user to enter a sequence of positive numbers one at a time
# and then stops asking when the sum exceeds 100, at which point it reports on the average of the numbers entered.

# Your program output should be as follows:
# Enter a sequence of positive numbers after the prompt >
# > 20
# > 30
# > 40
# > 50
# the total is 140.0
# you entered 4 numbers
# the mean value is 35.0
# the sum of the squares of the numbers is 5400.0
